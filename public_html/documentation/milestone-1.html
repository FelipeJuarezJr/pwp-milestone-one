                                Our audience is other small businesses in the Albuquerque area. These are small businesses that don't have in-house technical support specialist or web developers. They also cannot afford high priced corporate level companies for their tech needs.

                            <li>
                                Patricia owns a residential painting company in Albuquerque, NM. She just bought into this business and has a laundry list of Information Technology needs. She has worked in business administration and is proficient in MicroSoft Office, but nothing else IT related. She is smart and can usually figure problems out on her own, but just does not have the time to address all the issues currently plaguing the office. She is now on Google Search and looking for a local IT company to just come in and take care of it all. Patricia came across On Site IT Solutions LLC and is viewing thier website.

                        <h4>Frustrations</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Patricia's biggest frustration is that all the other IT business she has called for quotes on services talk to her in IT jargon she does not understand. Also, some of these campanies are big corporate companies that want to charge her outrages prices for simple work and cannot schedule her for at least a month out.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Goals</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Patricia is on OnSite-ITSolutions.com looking to see what services they offer. She wants a to clearly see a local phone number she can call, not one of those 1-800 numbers, and have a real person answer and not a phone cue or automation. Maybe she can even get a quote for basic services from the website.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Other Info</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Currently she needs to set up a solid wi-fi network in and around the office. Wireless printers should be added to the network after this. There is a ticketing system that runs on a server that she just can't get set up properly. Also, her painting companies website needs to be update with their new logo and picture of their work.
